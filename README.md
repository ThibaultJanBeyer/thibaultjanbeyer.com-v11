Source files for my personal site at thibaultjanbeyer.com (Version 10)  
Feel free to look around.  

The /src/ folder is probably what you are looking for since it is the uncompressed version. Hence src = source.   

My local folder structure looks like this:
> dist –– the clean distribution folder  
> gulp-tasks –– managing gulp  
> originals –– this folder holds all the .psd, .ai and other originals  
> src –– the working folder  
data.json is my “backend”  

*Note: you can find all versions of my website (starting at version 1 made in 2002) via http://blog.thibaultjanbeyer.com/portfolio/older-versions-of-my-website/*
